# Michigan Mainstream

For the Banner/logo My cousin and I are working on a few Designs but we could use a recommended size that fits your vision for the site plus you can come up with some designs too if you are interested.

## Banner
MichiganMainstream.TV
Michigan's Premier Internet TV Network 

## Home Page
It'd be cool to find a code that embeds the latest uploads from the channel, with a title "Recent Uploads"
If not a simple feed script I can post to would be cool, kinda like this page
http://rawradiox.com/
Then I could update it with the latest information or videos.

## Banner/Bar Titles (consistent on each page)
Home,Shows, About, Get Involved, Contacts, Sponsors

## Follow us Tabs: Facebook, Twitter, Email, Youtube.  
Subscribe button for youtube 
Facebook "Like" button (with 'Who likes" feed if possible)
www.facebook.com/MichiganMainstream
www.twitter.com/MiMainstream
MichiganMainstream@gmail.com
www.youtube.com/MichiganMainstream

## Shows (maybe a Drop down menu)
-The Show Show
-Sessions
-The Michigan Showcase
Embedded playlist for each show page. List form or whatever so long as you see an image and description for the video. Eventually if you give us the dimensions we could make side bars for each shows page.
